Description: genePackRat (Gene Packet-based Rating) provides a modular framework for
    prioritizing candidate genes from broad GWAS/QTL intervals. It creates
    standardized "gene packets" that consolidate gene annotations, public
    database information, and study-specific data into multi-sheet Excel
    workbooks for team-based curation. The package follows tidyverse design
    principles and supports any organism with appropriate annotation databases.
